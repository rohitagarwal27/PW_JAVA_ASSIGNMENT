1.what is computer ?
A computer is an electronic device that can perform various operations 
based on a set of instructions or programs. It consists of hardware and software components that work together to process and manipulate data.
2.what is the RAM
RAM stands for Random Access Memory, 
which is a type of computer memory that stores data and program instructions that are 
currently in use by the computer's CPU. RAM is a volatile memory, which means that it can only store data while 
the computer is powered on. When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are lost.


3.where the data stored in the computer ?
Random Access Memory (RAM): As mentioned earlier, RAM is a volatile memory that stores data and program instructions that are currently in use by the computer's CPU.

Read-Only Memory (ROM): ROM is a non-volatile memory that stores data and program instructions that are permanently stored in the computer. It typically contains the computer's firmware, including the BIOS that starts the computer when it is turned on.

Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs): These are non-volatile storage devices that store data and programs even when the computer is turned off. HDDs store data on spinning disks, while SSDs use flash memory to store data.

The input device used to type text and numbers on documents in the computer system is called a keyboard. 
A keyboard is a hardware device that is used to input text, numbers, and other symbols into a computer. 
The keyboard typically contains letters, numbers, and special characters arranged in a specific layout, such 
as the QWERTY layout. When a key on the keyboard is pressed, it sends an electrical signal to the computer, which then 
registers the corresponding character or symbol on the screen. Keyboards can be connected to a computer via a USB or wireless connection.
